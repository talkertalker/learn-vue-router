# learn-vue-router
A Vue.js project I'm currently working on to practice the vue-router plugin and the vue-cli.
It very quickly turned also into a project about learning how to plugin ESlint and include all of the files in a commit.

## To install dependencies

`npm install`

## To run

`npm start` or `npm run dev`
