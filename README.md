# learn-vue-router
A Vue.js project I'm currently working on to practice the vue-router plugin and the vue-cli.

It very quickly turned also into a project about learning how to plugin ESlint and include/locate all of its config files after the vue-cli set it up.

## To install dependencies

`npm install`

## To run

`npm start` or `npm run dev`
